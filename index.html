            <aside id="text">Let's go back to 1984 and <a class="links" href="http://www.cloudpaint.com/classic">the very first version of MacPaint</a> on an original Macintosh personal computer. I spent hours on this program creating all sorts of creatures, completly mesmorized with the technology!  Fast-forward 15 years, to my first 'real' job at a Molecular Genetics lab. The work was always exciting... but to be honest I found the most satisfaction in teaching myself how to take images from a microscope to Adobe Photoshop for <a href="http://dev.biologists.org/content/develop/133/24/4957.full.pdf"> publication</a>.  Through lots of trial and error I became the local Photoshop expert. Since that time, the kitchen has become my laboratory and home of the Bonneville Bakery. My favorite recipes and decorated sugar cookies are the heart of <a href="http://www.suzdaily.com/">suzdaily.com</a>. I am beyond excited to break-up with WordPress, finish this UofU Bootcamp strong and re-enter the workforce with the skills of a Web Developer.  I love spending any time with my family - baking, decorating, skiing, gardening, hiking and enjoying all that these beautiful mountains have to offer.</aside>
